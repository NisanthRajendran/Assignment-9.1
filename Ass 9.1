1.Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?
     *Pig is an application that runs on top of the MapReduce.
     *The Pig Script is internally converted into MapReduce Tasks and the required job is done
     *Thus MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming.
 
2.What are advantages of pig over MapReduce?
     *More lines of code is written in MapReduce and less lines of code is written in Pig.
     *Pig Latin code can be extended through various user defined functions that are written in Python, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, and Ruby.
     *Pig provides higher level of abstraction where as MapReduce provides lower level of abstraction.
     *Development effort is less in pig than Mapreduce.
     
3. What is pig engine and what is its importance?
     *Pig engine is a component of pig that accepts the Pig Latin scripts as input and converts those scripts into MapReduce jobs.
     *It acts as an intrepreter between MapReduce jobs and Pig latin script.
     
4. What are the modes of Pig execution?     
     There are two modes of Pig execution:
       *LOCAL MODE:       To run Pig in local mode, you need access to a single machine.
                          All the files are installed and run from your local host and local file system.
                          HDFS is not needed.
                    
       *MAPREDUCE MODE:   Here we load the data from hadoop file system using pig. 
                          When ever a pig statement is executed,map reduce job runs on the background to perform the specified operation
                          in the mentioned file.
